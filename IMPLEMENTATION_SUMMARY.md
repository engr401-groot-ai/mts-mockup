## New Files Created

### Hooks
- `src/hooks/useLocalStorage.ts` - Generic localStorage persistence hook
- `src/hooks/useDebounce.ts` - Debounce hook for search (200ms delay)

### Components
- Already had `BillCard.tsx`, `AmendmentDiff.tsx`, `SessionSelector.tsx`, `ProvenanceFooter.tsx`

### Pages
- All pages already existed from previous work

---

## Key Technologies Used

- **State Management**: React hooks + localStorage
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with URL params
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI (Select, Calendar, Checkbox, etc.)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Accessibility**: Focus-visible rings, aria-labels, semantic HTML
- **Data**: Mock data in `src/data/` directory

---

## Demo URLs

- **Triage with filters**: `/triage`
- **Loading state**: `/triage?state=loading`
- **Empty state**: `/triage?state=empty`
- **Error state**: `/triage?state=error`
- **Bill detail with tab**: `/bills/1?tab=amendments`
- **Hearing detail**: `/hearings/h1`
- **Digest builder**: `/digests/new`

---

## LocalStorage Keys

- `triage-filter` - Active filter (all/high/implicit/budget/land/workforce)
- `triage-sort` - Sort option (relevance-desc/relevance-asc/due-soon/owner-asc)
- `bill-metadata` - Bill-specific overrides (owner, dueDate, confidence)

---

## What's Still Stubbed (MVP Scope)

1. **Export functionality** - Shows toast "Coming soon"
2. **Digest PDF export** - Downloads HTML blob (not true PDF)
3. **Full bill search** - Only shows first 10 in digest builder
4. **Backend integration** - All data is static JSON in `/public/api/`
5. **Authentication** - No login required (public access)

---

## Accessibility Features

✅ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space, Esc)
✅ Focus indicators on all interactive elements
✅ ARIA labels for buttons and inputs
✅ Semantic HTML (header, main, nav, article)
✅ Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
✅ Screen reader friendly labels

---

## Performance Optimizations

- Debounced search (200ms) prevents excessive filtering
- LocalStorage for instant state restoration
- Lazy-loaded components (React.lazy where applicable)
- Memoized filter/sort operations
